# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```py
# Step 1: Define a tuple
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 10)

# Step 2: Check if 'n' is in the tuple
print("'n' in tuple:", 'n' in x)

# Step 3: Check if 8 is in the tuple
print("8 in tuple:", 8 in x)
```
